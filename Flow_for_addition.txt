To Do:
(enhancements)
1) size_t has bit size of 8(one byte) which is very small for the normal application. See if it can be replaced by CDADDRSIZE or CDDATASIZE. 
2) we can disable memory while accessing it by making cr1 as 0. Later make it 1 after using it.
(requirement)
1) We are adding two unsigned numbers/vector/matrixes with current code. Make it for all cases like float,int etc.
2) Focus on PAT. designed circuit should use as less PAT as possible. Power number we can't access but area and timeing we can get from the designed module(as done in assign1 and assign2).
	So, try reducing Area and Timing. Timing can we reduced by doing all the addition parallely(but not possible since memory is single ported)
3) write seperate test-bench module to initialize the vector/matrix.
